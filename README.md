[![Version](https://img.shields.io/static/v1.svg?style=for-the-badge&label=Version&message=0.0.0&labelColor=EEEEEE&color=E6E6E6&maxAge=3600)](https://github.com/nirvarnia/brand/releases)

## Requirements

To modify the source files, you will need [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/). 

The wordmark is created from the font `Bernard MT Condensed`, which you will need to have installed on your system. This font is distributed with Microsoft Office. If you do not use Microsoft Office, you can download the font, and buy a license to use it, [from the fonts.com website](https://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/monotype-bernard/licenses).

This license lets you use, copy and redistribute Nirvarnia logos and related brand artwork, as long as you do so for **non-commercial purposes**. You are also allowed to convert the artwork to other digital formats, such as PNG and JPEG, and to change the size of the artwork. But you are not allowed to make material changes to the design of the Nirvarnia brand and to distribute those modified versions.
